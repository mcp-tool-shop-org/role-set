"""Lessons, writer prompts, and the two quizzes per trait.

The writer is given the lesson, the counterweight, the procedure, and a ledger with the
verdict stripped. The prompt never says to write a brief, and a negative ledger is a
separate ledger: it does not say the writer was told to hide anything.
